## Introduction

Welcome to the Adult Salary Prediction project! This project aims to predict whether an individual earns more than $50K annually based on various demographic and employment-related features. Predicting income levels can be valuable for targeted marketing, policy planning, and more.

## Dataset

We used the [Adult Income dataset](insert_dataset_link_here) for this project. It contains information about individuals, including age, education, occupation, and more. The dataset is divided into a training set and a test set for model training and evaluation.

## Features

The dataset includes the following features:

- `age`: Age of the individual.
- `education`: Highest level of education.
- `occupation`: Type of occupation.
- `marital_status`: Marital status of the individual.
- `relationship`: Relationship status.
- `race`: Ethnicity of the individual.
- `sex`: Gender of the individual.
- `capital_gain`: Capital gains.
- `capital_loss`: Capital losses.
- `hours_per_week`: Number of hours worked per week.
- `native_country`: Native country.

## Data Preprocessing

Before building the machine learning model, we performed data preprocessing tasks, including:

- Handling missing values.
- Encoding categorical features.
- Scaling numerical features.
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We conducted EDA to gain insights into the dataset, including:

- Visualizations of feature distributions.
- Correlation analysis.
- Identification of outliers.

## Model Building

We experimented with several machine learning algorithms, including:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

We selected the [best performing model](insert_model_name_here) based on evaluation metrics.

## Model Evaluation

We evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The [selected model](insert_model_name_here) achieved an accuracy of [accuracy_percentage_here] on the test set.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project demonstrates the process of building a machine learning model to predict adult salaries based on demographic and employment-related features. The model achieved [accuracy_percentage_here] accuracy, which makes it valuable for predicting income levels.

## Future Improvements

Future improvements for this project could include:

- Fine-tuning hyperparameters for better performance.
- Exploring advanced feature engineering techniques.
- Deploying the model as a web application for user-friendly predictions.
